  <br>Hair is an efficient barometer of good health. While hereditary influences obviously determine colour, texture and type, the basic requirements for maintaining sound condition are, good diet, adequate exercise, relaxation and sleep, adequate elimination, and regular brushing with a bristle brush (nylon damages and splits the ends).</br>
  <br>Green salads, fresh raw vegetables, fresh fruit, fish, liver, raisins, wheat germ, sunflower oil are important sources of the 'hair' vitamins, A, C and B complex, and the minerals copper, iron and iodine.</br>
  <br>To clean and condition hair, the consumer society offers us a wide range of detergent shampoos, chemically-based rinses, bleaches and tints — and a large measure of propaganda. Alternatives are however, available, which have stood the test of time, and which as natural pro-, ducts, have no need of massive advertising campaigns to try and prove their worth.</br>
  <br><p style="color:red">SHAMPOOS</p></br>
  <br><p style="color:red">Dry Shampoo:</p>  Sprinkle Fuller's earth onto the scalp, after parting the hair, leave for ten minutes, then brush the hair vigorously.  This method can also be used with with orris root.</br>
  <br><p style="color:red">Wet Shampoos:</p> Mix the juice of one lemon with one egg and add a tea-spoonful of lavender or rose-water. Whisk the mixture thoroughly and massage into the scalp. Leave for ten minutes, then rinse off, taking care to use warm, not hot, water otherwise you'll have scrambled hair. If your hair is particularly dry, a mixture of one teaspoonful almond oil to one egg, and one lemon may be used. Do not be tempted to leave out the lemon on the grounds that it has a drying effect, otherwise your hair may smell after a day or two.</br>
  <br><p style="color:red">Soap-based Shampoo:</p> One of the purest soaps available is Pear's which has a very low residue of alkali in comparison with others. Shave off a few strips of soap with a knife, and put into a bowl. Barely cover with boiling water and stir slowly to melt the soap, without causing too much lather at this stage. Add a quarter cup of strongly infused chamomile, if fair-haired, or rosemary if reviously dark-haired. This infusion is p  made by adding four times the volume of water to the volume of fresh herb, or six times the volume of dried herb, then simmering for ten minutes in a saucepan with a lid, and finally strain-ing when cool. The shampoo is massaged well into the scalp, left for five minutes, then rinsed thoroughly. Any herbal in-fusion left over can be diluted to half strength with water, and used as a final conditioning rinse.</br>
  <br><p style="color:red">Soapwort Shampoo:</p> I'm told that the plant Soapwort (Saponaria officinal's) which has a high concentration of saponin, and consequently lathers with water, can be used as an alternative to soap, or as a basis for a 'soap' shampoo. I have no personal experience of using Soapwort, and would therefore hesitate to recommend it to others, but if any-one does have experience of this, I would be pleased to hear from them.</br>
  <br><p style="color:red">Commerical Herbal Shampoo:</p> If you don't want to mess about making your own shampoo, yet are reluctant to use the detergents camouflaged by chemical colourings and smells offered by the consumer society, a good alternative in the form of Rosemary Hair Shampoo, is offered by Dorwest Herb Growers of Ship ton Gorge, Bridport, Dorset. They operate a mail-order service, with a 10% discount for registered customers; will sell you any quantity for 52cc up tp 4 kilos at a time, and are pleased to send details on application.</br>
  <br><p style="color:red">CONDITIONERS</p></br>
  <br><p style="color:red">Nettle juice:</p> Place a dozen young nettle tops in 2 pints of water and simmer for Nettie hour. Strain and bottle when half an  cool. Use either as a final rinse after washing, or if hair is particularly dull and listless, massage into the scalp twice a week.</br>
  <br><p style="color:red">Rosemary: </p>Using 6 sprigs of fresh rosemary leaves, or 2 level teaspoonfuls of the dried herb, to 2 pints of water, follow the method outlined for nettle juice.</br>
  <br><p style="color:red">Rosemary & Borax:</p> Place 2 level tea-spoonfuls of dried rosemary leaves, or 6 sprigs of the fresh herb, in 2 pints of water, and simmer for half an hour. Add one teaspoonful of borax, mix well, then strain and bottle when cool. Massage into the scalp twice a week if you have dandruff or scurf.</br>
  <br><p style="color:red">Scabious:</p> Boil a dozen scabious flowers in 1 pint of water for 10 minutes. Leave to steep, then strain and bottle when cool. Rub a little into the scalp every night if dandruff is particularly troublesome.</br>

  <div class="article3_text">
  <br>I should like to comment on your hen keeping articles in the light of our own experience. We sell eggs on a small scale to contribute to the running of our smallholding, and obviously, reliable egg production is very important, as well as handiness, ranging qualities, shape and texture of egg, and a degree of freedom from broodiness. We have obtained very pleasing results from Rangers, bought as point of lay pullets from a commercial rearer. We bought these in the wet autumn of 1974, and in spite of the fact that they had been reared indoors and had to adjust to outdoor life and a complete change of diet, they all did well. They came into lay within a month, and laid clutches of up to 20 eggs consecutively — egg production during that winter was 60-70%. The eggs are well formed, and have rich orange yolks from a diet of left over school meals, grain and grass. The birds were fairly free from broodiness, but we found they could be discouraged form broodiness quite easily by means of solitary confinement in an open cage. We allowed one Ranger to brood and she proved extremely sufficient and a good mother. Crossed with our Rhode Island cock, they gave us several red cockerels for the table.</br>

  <br>With this type of experiment, we found your articles on hybrids rather biased, especially as our own experience of Light Sussex has been extremely un-fortunate. The 5 birds we had from a well-know breeder laid infrequently, their eggs were thin-shelled and misshapen, and they were difficult to cure of broodiness and very clumsy as broodies. Their ranging abilities were no better than those of the Rangers, who suffered from a disability in this, respect since they had been severely 'de-beaked'. And finally, our Rangers cleverly staggered their moult and are now all back in lay.</br>

  <br>Another type of hybrid that we are very pleased with is the Warren — we bought a dozen from a battery house which was selling off its old birds cheaply to make way for the new pullets. We chose the best feathered of these birds — some had virtually no feathers left due to feather eating in the cages. These birds adjusted very well to life out of doors, were avid grazers, and continued laying large eggs at the rate of 6-10 daily, for a good 3 moults after they had been cast out from the battery. These eggs in fact won prizes every time I exhibited them in local shows! The only trouble we had from them was a tendency of some to go broody — and yet we are told the hybrids will not go broody.</br>

  <br>In conclusion, we will always keep a majority of hybrids — if Rangers are hybrids and not straight crosses which is possible. Can anyone tell us? We keep a couple of Marans whose sole job is to brood and produce young cocks for the pot, and we have slaughtered all our Light Sussex! (Chris and Robin Roy, Torrington, Devon).</br>

  <br>We have now been keeping hens for one year and can say that it is profit-able ignoring the initial capital. We started when offered some ex-battery hens for 35p each, their feet were in a terrible state. We have eaten one of these hens but will not eat the others as they are hybrids and very lean and tough; the cost of fattening them would not be worthwhile. We also bought 6 point of lay birds and al-though they were starting to lay (2 finger test) they did not produce any eggs for over a month. We also had a lot of trouble mixing the two sets of birds. This was finally achieved by separating run and house with chicken wire so that the hens were separate but could see each other. After a month or two we removed the wire. We still noticed a drop in eggs for about a week.</br>

  <br>At present we have twelve birds and one cockerel who will soon be meat. Last summer we averaged 7-8 eggs a day. At present we have 3 a day until the recent cold spell when it dropped to 3 every other day. The good supply of eggs during the summer allowed us to put down 50-100 in waterglass and sell the others to cover food and the intial outlay of £1.50 per bird.</br>

  <br>Food wise we used to feed dry mash twice a day and this 56 lb. only lasted 2 weeks. At first it was 12 % protein mash but when our new hens weren't laying, we asked the man who sold them to have a look and he suggested a 16-17 % mesh. We have since found that if we feed dry mash in the morn-ing we can feed a wet mash at night. The wet mash consists of household scraps and vegetables boiled up. This makes our mash last a good one month.</br>

  <br>We would however never buy hybrid point of lay pullets and would as you suggest buy a pure breed. (A. M. Law, N. Leverton, Notts.)</br>

  <br>We would like to leap to the defence of the RIR cockerel and the Warren hen. These breeds of poultry were slandered in PSS 2. It takes all sorts of cocks and hens to make the poultry world and aggressiveness will appear to some extent in all breeds, it will de-pend on the particular strain of bird and also to some extent on the condition in which they live. However, in general the RIR cockerel is docile, this was the characteristic for which he was chosen as the father of the battery hen. The Warren is a battery bird who is, in general, docile. From first hand experience we have a gentle-man RIR cockerel who has shown no tendency to be aggressive to humans; also six ex-battery Warren hens who are very mild natured. In fact our only aggressive bird is a Light Sussex-Rhode Island Red cross.</br>

  <br>It is not absolutely necessary to have artificial heat to bring on day old chicks. We have reared these, in August, using a hexagonal foam insulated box, approx. 2ft across. It is important that the foam is covered with some smooth lining or the chicks peck at it — we used purlboard.</br>

  <br>Although we had a source of heat handy we found it unnecessary as the heat of the chicks warmed the insulated box to an adequate temperature. After 2 weeks they were allowed to run in the shed if they wanted to and at 3-4 weeks, no longer needed the box. From 4 weeks old we let them have access to a protected run outside. We had no casualties. (Sim and Geoff Fowler).</br>

  <br><p style="color:red">An introduction by Peter Stickley</p></br>
  <br>The single most important thing about beekeeping is bees. There are many 'races' which have evolved in various parts of Europe and the Middle East any many more strains within the races. For a beginner the best bees are the ones which survive4n your locality. They probably have good disease resistance and a brood-raising cycle which matches the local flora. Plenty of time for experiment with imported queens and bee-breeding when you know what you're doing! Get your bees, then, from a reputable local apiarist or take a swarm  (details later). 1975 was a year with very few swarms, so this year will probably see a superabundance of them. Most people are only too glad to have a swarm removed from their gardens, so register your name at the local Police station, and wait for the phone to ring in May, June or July.</br>
  <br><p style="color:red">Hives</p></br>
  <br>The most common mistake made by beginners is to buy one of those pretty (but very old-fasioned) white-painted hives which anyone would recognise as a beehive — this pattern; the W.B.C. or 'Cottager" hive, might have been designed to make bees angry and get beekeepers stung. If you have, or hope to have, a prolific queen (which you should) go for the Jumbo" hive 20 inches long, 16'/4" wide and 11 9/16" deep, with 10 frames spaced 1 3/8" apart using Hoffman spacing. The length and width are the interliational Langstroth size (so you can use standard honey supers 5 X" deep, and all standard parts will fit on or under) which is the most widely used size world wide.</br>
  <br>If you're using second-hand equipment make very sure it's disease-free (find out why the seller is giving up) and scorch all hive parts black with a blow-lamp to be sure. NEVER paint brood boxes or supers nectar has a lot of water in it which the bees have to evaporate before it becomes honey, and some of this needs egress through the wood. All hives should be made of good quality Western Red Cedar, which needs no paint, anyway. It's probably a good idea, though to paint the roof, and white is a good colour for this unless your hives will be away from houses where they may be vandalised. In this situation, an inconspicuous brown is as good as any, but may lead to bees spending effort cooling the hive in the summer when they should be working productively. Some hives have sheet metal roof covers which need no paint. Creosote is OK on the outside of a hive, provided it's weathered so there's no smell. One last word on hives - - the most widely used hive in Britain is the B.S.S. 'National' or 'Modified National'. Its brood chamber is too small for a worthwhile queen, so you have to use two chambers (there's only one queen per colony). This is a pointless increase in your capital investment. Two 'National' brood chambers cost 1.20, one 'Jumbo' £7.35.</br>
  <br><p style="color:red">Protection</p></br>
  <br>Bees sting, so beekeepers get stung. Proper clothing and a good veil will give you confidence to handle bees gently and unhurriedly, so you won't make them angry, Buy a white govt. surplus boiler suit (about £5.00), sew Velcro up the front in place of buttons, and 1/2" poppers on the cuffs so the bees can't crawl up your sleeves. Wear yellow 'Marigold' gloves if you must (sealed to the cuffs with rubber bands),but dispense with them if possible. Your veil will be your most important single purchase, as bees instinctively fly to one's head to sting. The best kind is that which fits over a brimmed hat and is made of four wire mesh panels (£3.15). Don't economise on the veil — when you regret doing so, it'll be too late! The last word here — NEVER EVER wear woollen clothing or any-thing blue when working with bees. Either or both will lead to needless stinging.</br>
  <br><p style="color:red">Other Equipment</p></br>
  <br>Bees seal small gaps in the hive with a bud exudation called 'bee glue' (propolis). You'll need a hive tool to break the seals between tiers of boxes, when taking off the inner cover (inside the roof) and when taking a frame out of a box for inspection, You could use an old chisel or screwdriver, but these are more liable to damage woodwork. At E1.70 a proper hive tool is a good buy, and is a useful multi-purpose scraper/nail drawer/ hooker-upper/light hammer. A smoker is essential. Smoking may damage your health but it won't hurt bees -- just make them easier to handle because they gorge honey when smoked. This is an instinctive reaction to the danger of forest fire and having to leave home in a hurry . When they're full of honey they're much more tractable.</br>

  <br>Soaps have been used for cleaning people and their possessions is attractive to water and a long 'tail' which, i while b 'head' which for at least 2,000 years.</br>
  <br>They work by having a molecule of two parts; a ‘head’ which is attractive to water and long ‘tail’ which, while being water repellent is attractive to oils and grease. As most dirt  water onto clothes and skins by greasy substances, the ‘tail’ of the soap molecules attract grease spots away from the surface 'tails' of t e being washed, and they and the dirt float free in the water.</br>
  <br><p style="color:red">Making Your Own Soap</p></br>
  <br>The simplest way is to start with white wood ash or potash. This contains an alkali or 'lye' and if nothing else is available it can be used as a soap substitute — but beware — its corrosive.</br>
  <br>A more effective, and less murderous soap can be made by the combination of lye and fat.</br>
  <br><p style="color:red">Other Sources of Lye</p></br>
  <br>The best land plants for lye-making are, in descending order: bean stalks, maize stalks, reeds, rushes, thistles, flax stems, broom, heaths, furze, sugar beet residue. The solid woods are not particularly good; the worst being pine and fir trees.</br>
  <br>Seaweeds yield an abundance of alkali in the form of soda-ash from which lye can be extracted.</br>
  <br><p style="color:red">Extracting the Lye</p></br>
  <br>Burn the plant material to ashes. A woodstove is ideal for this, otherwise a small bonfire outside will suffice. In the home-steading days of America, wood stoves were designed so that the ash could be scooped into a special trough. The ash was then sold to soap makers or used for their own soap-making. Put the ash in a lye-dropper — a perforated container made of wood, enamel, stoneware or iron, but not aluminium. Pour boiling water onto the ashes and allow to drain through the perforations into a second container made of any of the above materials. A good stir helps to mix it up. Strain the liquid through muslin to get rid of any surplus ash and when cool, pop an egg into it. If the egg floats the concentration is about right. If it sinks, pour the liquid into a iron or enamel pot and boil down until the right concentration is reached. Now you're ready for the fat.</br>
  <br><p style="color:red">Source of Fat</p></br>
  <br>Tallow or Land are recommended, but any of the flooding can be used — vegetable oil, beef far and all spare grease from bones etc.</br>
  <br>Hard commercial soaps are derived from palm oil, vile oil, nut oil and tallow — so you might like to experiment with mixed oils and fats. The oils and fats to be used should be clean and nor smell. Of they’re not clean they can be boiled up water, allowed to cool and then skimmed off the surface.</br>
  <br>Putting the ingredients together</p></br>
  <br>3 gallons of lye to 2 lbs. of grease or fat is about the right proportion, but as one of the difficulties is being left with excess lye at the end (making a harsh cruel soap) the best method is to add less lye initially and gradually add more as it is used  up and absorbed by the fat.</br>
  <br>Stir it up from time to time — a long thick twig will do — and leave it in an out-of-the-way place, like an old shed,  and re where small children aren't likely to fall in it and burn themselves.</br>
  <br>After a couple of weeks a mixture of soap and glycerol have formed and before the soap can harden, the glycerol must be removed.</br>
  <br>Add a 50% solution of brine (salt and water) until the soap separates out of top. The glycerol and any other impurities stays at the bottom with the brine. Skim the soap off the top and then press into moulds lined with muslin — wooden boxes will do. Leave for a few weeks before using.</br>
  <br><p style="color:red">Some Soap Economies</p></br>
  <br>All the leftover bits of soap can be collected and cut into pieces. If covered with boiling water in something like an iron pan or stew jar, and gently heated and stirred a soap jelly can be made. This can be used for washing oneself or one's clothes.</br>
  <br>Alternatively the left over bits can be used by putting them in a plastic mesh or string net bag, sometimes used for packing nuts or fruits. If a knot is tied above the soap, the bag can be used for washing hands. It has in fact the extra advantage that the mesh acts as an extra abrasive material, so use it regularly when hands are covered with four and pastry; or when you have been gardening or odd-jobbing.</br>
  <br><p style="color:red">Other cleaning agents</p></br>
  <br>Bran water is still recommended for washing delicate fabrics instead of soap. It is made by boiling a large cupful of bran in a quart of water for half an hour. Dilute again before use for washing.</br>
  <br>Fullers earth is a very fine clay found in many places in Britain it has a soapy feel and absorbs grease. It acts as a cleaner either on its own or mixed with soap.</br>
  <br>Various additives to soap increase its cleaning power. Washing soda (sodium carbonate-lye) which softens the water — saving some soap — and also acts as a solvent of the greases. But used in excess it destroys fabrics and dyes and irritates the skin.</br>
  <br>Borax has a similar effect to soda but without the disadvantages. It is not however available on our own doorstep like soda.</br>

  <div class="course_text">
  <br>There is a growing awareness that we are now in an era of transition to a post-industrial society. Many people hope that this new society will be both sustainable and  and fulfilling and there is a degree of consensus concerning its nature. It will, for example, be less centralised and will involve a much lesser degree o specialisation than at present. People will acquire a greater degree of control over their own lives, will be more self.reliant and will therefore wish to acquire a wider range of skills and knowledge than they are at present able to do. The process of transition will be greatly eased if people are able to acquire such skills and knowledge early in the transition. Already there are many thousands who wish to do so, and there are a number of ways in which they seek to achieve this end. There are innumerable books now available, a few periodicals and even a few courses, although the latter are mainly limited to short courses run by private organisations and a few longer informal courses for which the students provide the finance.</br>
  <br>There are also many evening classes, and people concerned with evolving sustainable life styles make increasing use of these. In my own area, a very useful evening class in "Self -Sufficiency" is run each year, and courses in woodwork, metalwork, home maintenance, vegetable growing, pottery and other crafts are available. Schools, especially some of the more progressive comprehensives, teach many skills, but in the current climate of financial stringency the craft courses are unfairly penalised by expenditure cuts.</br>
  <br>Perhaps most significant of all are the many thousands of people throughout the country who are teaching themselves new skills and ways of living, either in the context of nuclear or extended families, or else in communities. While this is the most productive method, certainly in terms of learning from experience and thereby gaining confidence, it is also necessarily a lengthy process. Most people remain in more-or-less full-time employment and their efforts are largely spare-time. Any wish to engage in a period of full-time study is prevented by lack of courses in the formal education system and of money to go on the privately- run courses.</br>
  <br>You could argue that it is not the job of the formal education system to develop comprehensive courses in autonomous living. But there is already a demand for such courses and there must surely be people within the education system who are not so constrained by convention that they are unable to respond to the need.</br>
  <br>What is needed is a course of theory and practice on all aspects of autonomous living. It would probably last about three years, but people might take five or six years to complete it, breaking off for lengthy periods to supplement their course experience by long periods of practical work.</br>
  <br>The course might cover:</br>
  <br>Basic human biology, nutrition and health studies, including alternative medicine.</br>
  <br>Plant and animal food production and preservation, both principle and practice, and including land tenure, land reform and planning. Basic crafts and skills and their use in providing shelter and clothing. Energy use and conservation, transport and communications. Historic and current patterns in alternative lifestyles including social, economic and psychological aspects.</br>
  <br>A major problem for the people participating would be finance. To be assured of a grant, the course would have to lead to a degree, diploma or other qualification acceptable to grant-awarding local authorities. This would be elitist and undesirable and, in any case, if.the course is really practical then it will be largely self-financing, with a blurring of the traditional distinction between teacher and taught, with all participants building their own living, studying and working accommodation, growing their own food, making their own clothes and continually experimenting with the organisation of all these activities. In such circumstances, course running costs and living costs for the students would both be much lower than a conventional course and people could more easily be self-financing (and local authorities might even be prepared to give modest grants even if the all-important degree certificate was lot forthcoming at the end!)</br>
  <br>We are then left with the question )f how this kind of course can be developed. Although some independent  groups and organisations are already doing it on a small scale, the knowledge and experience  needed. Probably the best all combination would be a polytechnic and a technical college together with a wider range of help, especially if the polytechnic or tech. Included people involved in agriculture and horticulture.</br>
  <br>Take as an example my own locality, Huddersfield. We have a technical college which includes a comprehensive range of departments with many staff highly skilled in such subjects as building, metal and wood. work, agriculture, horticulture, accounting and environmental studies. We have a polytechnic which includes. ecologists, sociologists, psychologists and architects. Far more important than this, there are people who are sympathetic to the notion of transition and are already shaping their own lifestyles accordingly. There are several communities around Huddersfield, including quite a large one, Lifespan, involving nearly thirty people, and at least two co-operatively run wholefood shops, one of which also acts increasingly as a focus for interest in alternatives.</br>
  <br>In this part of the country, interest in many self-reliant skills has survived and even thrives. Skilled "amateurs" are around who spin, weave, make shoes and succeed in many other crafts. Given the catalyst of perhaps half a dozen committed people, it would not be difficult to bring together a group to develop and organise the course.</br>
  <br>There are no doubt other places in the country where the appropriate combination of circumstances exists and I would be pleased to pass on some more detailed notes to anyone interested (s.a.e. please to me at the address below.)</br>
  <br>The committed alternative freak may view all this with horror, seeing conventional educational centres "taking over" and subverting the alternative dream. On the other hand, many people involved in "education" will consider the very idea of a course in "co-operated self-reliance" to be ridiculous. Yet somewhere in between there are already thousands of people who want to experience such an opportunity and recognise it as an essential factor if we are to achieve a stable transition to a sustainable post-industrial society.
